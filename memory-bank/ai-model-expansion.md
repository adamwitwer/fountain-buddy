# AI Model Expansion - Phase 3 Complete

## 🎯 Objective
Expand the bird classifier from 13 classes to 19 classes to support both fountain and peanut feeder species in a unified model.

## 📊 Species Mapping

### Current 13-Class Model (Legacy)
- American Robin, Blue Jay, Catbird, Common Grackle, European Starling, Gray Catbird, House Finch, House Sparrow, Mourning Dove, Northern Cardinal, Red-winged Blackbird, Song Sparrow, Squirrel

### Target 19-Class Unified Model
- **Fountain Species (11)**: American Robin, Blue Jay, Common Grackle, European Starling, Gray Catbird, House Finch, House Sparrow, Mourning Dove, Northern Cardinal, Song Sparrow, Squirrel
- **Peanut Species (10)**: Black-capped Chickadee, Carolina Wren, Downy Woodpecker, European Starling, Hairy Woodpecker, Northern Flicker, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Squirrel, Tufted Titmouse, White-breasted Nuthatch
- **Cross-location**: European Starling, Squirrel

### Changes Made
- **Added 8 new species**: Black-capped Chickadee, Carolina Wren, Downy Woodpecker, Hairy Woodpecker, Northern Flicker, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Tufted Titmouse, White-breasted Nuthatch
- **Removed 1 species**: Red-winged Blackbird (replaced focus)
- **Consolidated naming**: Catbird → Gray Catbird

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Created

### 1. Species Mapping System (`species_mapping.py`)
- **UNIFIED_SPECIES_LIST**: 19-class alphabetically organized list
- **SPECIES_LOCATIONS**: Maps each species to fountain/peanut/both
- **OLD_TO_NEW_MAPPING**: Migration path from 13→19 classes
- **Validation functions**: Ensure mapping consistency

### 2. Training Data Preparation (`prepare_training_data.py`)
- **Data migration**: Moved 994 images from old→new structure
- **Database extraction**: Pulled 1,056 human-verified identifications
- **Location organization**: Created `training_data_unified/` with 19 species dirs
- **Gap analysis**: Identified 8 missing peanut species

### 3. Unified Trainer (`bird_trainer_unified.py`)
- **19-class ResNet-50**: Custom head for unified classification
- **Two-phase training**: Frozen base → fine-tuning approach
- **Multi-location support**: Handles fountain + peanut data
- **Auto-fallback**: Uses best available data per species

### 4. Enhanced Classifier (`custom_bird_classifier.py`)
- **Auto-detection**: Tries unified model first, falls back to legacy
- **Version tracking**: Shows which model is loaded
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing code works unchanged

## 📊 Current Data Status

### Ready for Training (≥20 images)
1. **American Robin**: 104 images ✅
2. **Blue Jay**: 33 images ✅  
3. **Common Grackle**: 59 images ✅
4. **European Starling**: 161 images ✅
5. **Gray Catbird**: 104 images ✅
6. **House Sparrow**: 145 images ✅

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 3A: Foundation Complete ✅
- ✅ Species mapping and validation
- ✅ Training data structure migration  
- ✅ Unified trainer implementation
- ✅ Enhanced classifier with auto-fallback
- ✅ Infrastructure for 19-class model

### Phase 3B: Data Collection (Next)
1. **Deploy multi-camera system** to start collecting peanut feeder data
2. **Monitor peanut camera** for new species appearances
3. **Human verification** of peanut species via Discord
4. **Iterative training** as new species data accumulates

### Phase 3C: Model Training (Future)
1. **Intermediate training**: Start with 8 ready species
2. **Incremental expansion**: Add species as data becomes available  
3. **Cross-location learning**: Leverage European Starling data from both locations
4. **Performance validation**: Test accuracy across all locations

## 🎯 Benefits of Unified Approach

### Technical Advantages
- **Single model maintenance**: One training pipeline, one deployment
- **Cross-location learning**: European Starling data from both cameras improves accuracy
- **Efficient inference**: No routing logic needed between models
- **Scalable architecture**: Easy to add more cameras/locations

### Operational Benefits
- **Consistent species identification**: Same AI across all locations
- **Simplified deployment**: One model file to manage
- **Better generalization**: More diverse training data improves robustness
- **Future-proof**: Ready for 3rd, 4th camera additions

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 4)
1. **Start peanut camera operation** with multi-camera system
2. **Begin collecting peanut species data** through Discord verification
3. **Monitor data accumulation** for each missing species

### Short-term
1. **First unified training** when 5+ peanut species have ≥10 images each
2. **A/B testing** between legacy 13-class and new unified model
3. **Performance monitoring** across both locations

### Long-term
1. **Full 19-class deployment** when all species have sufficient data
2. **Continuous learning** integration with auto-retraining
3. **Species expansion** as new birds are discovered

## 🔧 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `species_mapping.py` - Species classification and validation
- `prepare_training_data.py` - Training data migration and analysis  
- `bird_trainer_unified.py` - 19-class model trainer
