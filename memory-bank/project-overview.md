# Fountain Buddy - Project Overview

## üìã Quick Summary
**Fountain Buddy** is an AI-powered bird identification system that combines computer vision with human expertise to create an accurate backyard bird monitoring system. It watches a fountain/water feature, detects birds, identifies species using AI, then sends Discord notifications for human verification.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components

### Core Files
- **`run.py`** - Main application with camera monitoring, YOLO detection, and species classification
- **`discord_bot.py`** - Bot that processes human identification responses via Discord
- **`bird_trainer.py`** - AI model training system using transfer learning (ResNet-50)
- **`auto_retrain.py`** - Automated retraining trigger when 15+ corrections collected
- **`custom_bird_classifier.py`** - Custom bird species classifier wrapper
- **`photo_cleanup_scheduler.py`** - Automated photo organization and cleanup
- **`photo_organizer.py`** - Core photo organization logic

### Data Structure
- **`bird_images/active/`** - Current bird photos (renamed with species after identification)
- **`training_data/`** - Organized photos for AI model training
- **`models/`** - Trained AI models (custom classifier)
- **`fountain_buddy.db`** - SQLite database with bird visit records

## üîÑ Workflow

### 1. Detection Phase
1. Camera monitors for motion/AI triggers (Reolink integration)
2. YOLO detects and crops birds from images
3. Custom classifier predicts species
4. Image saved with timestamp

### 2. Human Verification
1. Discord notification sent with image + AI prediction + numbered species options
2. Human replies with number (1-10) or species name
3. Database updated with verified species
4. Image renamed to include correct species

### 3. Continuous Learning
1. Verified identifications become training data
2. Auto-retraining triggers nightly at 11 PM when 15+ new samples collected
3. New model automatically loaded without restart
4. AI accuracy improves over time

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Hardware/External
- **Reolink camera** with AI detection capability
- **Discord** for human-in-the-loop verification
- **Email** for daily summaries

### AI/ML
- **YOLOv8** for bird detection and cropping
- **Custom ResNet-50** fine-tuned for local bird species
- **Transfer learning** pipeline for continuous improvement

### Backend
- **Python 3.8+** with virtual environment
- **SQLite** database for visit records
- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for neural networks
- **APScheduler** for automated tasks

## üìä Key Features

### Smart Detection
- Motion/AI triggered capture (efficient monitoring)
- YOLO bird detection (never miss a visitor)
- Species classification (AI + human verification)

### Human-AI Collaboration
- Discord integration with numbered quick responses
- Real-time database updates and file renaming
- Confidence tracking (AI vs human accuracy)

### Self-Training System
- Automated model retraining (nightly at 11 PM)
- Quality control (human-verified data only)
- Continuous accuracy improvement

### Data Management
- Organized file structure with species names
- Daily email summaries with accurate counts
- Long-term visit tracking and analysis

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
- Camera connection (IP, credentials, ports)
- Discord integration (webhook, bot token, channel)
- Email settings (Gmail recommended)
- YOLO model configuration (confidence thresholds, cooldown)

### Database Schema
```sql
bird_visits (
    id, timestamp, bird_type, species, confidence, image_path
)
```

## üéØ Current State & Recent Changes
- Fixed bird classifier to prevent ImageNet fallback contamination
- Replaced Red-winged Blackbird with European Starling in species list
- Added auto-checkmark to original detection messages
- Improved automation to use virtual environment for training
- Active photo cleanup and organization system

## üìà Daily Operations
- **11:00 PM**: Auto-retraining check + daily email summary
- **Continuous**: Bird detection, Discord notifications, human verification
- **Background**: Photo organization and cleanup scheduling

## üöÄ Deployment & Services
- **`fountain-buddy`** - systemd service running main detection loop (run.py)
- **`discordbot`** - systemd service running Discord monitoring (discord_bot.py)
- **Restart both services** after configuration changes:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart fountain-buddy
  sudo systemctl restart discordbot
  ```
