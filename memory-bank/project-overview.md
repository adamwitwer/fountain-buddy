# Fountain Buddy - Project Overview

## 📋 Quick Summary
**Fountain Buddy** is an AI-powered bird identification system that combines computer vision with human expertise to create an accurate backyard bird monitoring system. It watches a fountain/water feature, detects birds, identifies species using AI, then sends Discord notifications for human verification.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Components

### Core Files

- **`training_improvements_summary.py`** - 🆕 **Training performance tracking and analysis**

### Data Structure
- **`bird_images/active/`** - Current bird photos (renamed with species after identification)
- **`training_data_unified/`** - 🆕 **Unified training structure combining human + NABirds data**
- **`nabirds_training_data/`** - 🆕 **Professional NABirds images (265+ samples, balanced by species)**
- **`models/`** - Trained AI models (enhanced model prioritized automatically)
- **`fountain_buddy.db`** - SQLite database with bird visit records

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Detection Phase
1. Camera monitors for motion/AI triggers (Reolink integration)
2. YOLO detects and crops birds from images
3. Custom classifier predicts species
4. Image saved with timestamp

### 2. Human Verification
1. Discord notification sent with image + AI prediction + numbered species options
2. Human replies with number (1-10) or species name
3. Database updated with verified species
4. Image renamed to include correct species

### 3. Continuous Learning
1. Verified identifications become training data
2. Auto-retraining triggers nightly at 11 PM when 15+ new samples collected
3. New model automatically loaded without restart
4. AI accuracy improves over time
