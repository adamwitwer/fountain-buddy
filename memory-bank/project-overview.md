## üîÑ Workflow

### üöÄ Production Workflow (Mac Services)
Both services run automatically in background via macOS launchd:
- **Camera Service** continuously monitors cameras
- **Discord Bot Service** continuously listens for responses

### 1. Detection Phase
1. **Camera Service** (`run.py`) monitors for motion/AI triggers (Reolink integration)
2. YOLO detects and crops birds from images
3. Custom classifier predicts species
4. Image saved with timestamp

### 2. Human Verification
1. **Camera Service** sends Discord notification with image + AI prediction + species options
2. **Discord Bot Service** receives human reply (number 1-10 or species name)
3. **Discord Bot Service** updates database with verified species
4. Image renamed to include correct species and location

### 3. Continuous Learning (Apple Silicon Accelerated)
1. Verified identifications become training data
2. **Auto-retraining** triggers nightly at 11 PM when 15+ new samples collected
3. **M4 Pro training** completes in ~15 minutes (vs 2+ hours previously)
4. New model automatically loaded without service restart
5. AI accuracy improves rapidly with fast iteration cycle
